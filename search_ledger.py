"""search_ledger.py — what have we actually searched, and how much is left?

A null result is only worth something if you can say what you covered. Without a
ledger you cannot quote a limit, you cannot avoid re-searching the same ground,
and "we found nothing" means nothing. This records every run so the search has a
denominator.

    python search_ledger.py record --target GJ699 --path data/x.h5 --recipe all
    python search_ledger.py coverage          # the headline percentages
    python search_ledger.py list              # what has been searched

WHAT "PERCENT SEARCHED" HONESTLY MEANS
--------------------------------------
There is no single true denominator, so this reports several and refuses to
collapse them into one number:

  * BYTES of the public archive we have actually opened. Breakthrough Listen's
    open-data release is the big one — of order 1 PB and growing (Lebofsky et al.
    2019 PASP 131:124505; Price et al. 2020 AJ 159:86). This is the number that
    is honest about how little any hobbyist has touched. Set the denominator
    yourself with SETI_ARCHIVE_BYTES if you have a better figure; the default is
    an ORDER-OF-MAGNITUDE estimate and is labelled as such everywhere.
  * TARGETS: distinct stars we have looked at, against the ~1,700 in the BL
    primary nearby-star sample.
  * The COVERAGE VOLUME that actually matters scientifically, which is not bytes
    at all: (targets) x (bandwidth) x (time) x (drift range) x (sensitivity). Two
    searches over the same file with different detectors are NOT duplicates —
    they cover different signal space. Bytes-searched is an upper bound on effort
    and a lower bound on insight.

So: treat the byte percentage as "how much of the haystack have we lifted", and
the per-recipe records as "which needles could we have seen". Both are in here.
