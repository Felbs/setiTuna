"""Galactic hydrogen and the maser lines - the natural narrowband signals that a
technosignature search finds *instead* of aliens, and the reason a bright narrow
line is not news by itself.

Neutral hydrogen radiates at 1420.405751768 MHz (the 21 cm hyperfine spin-flip).
It is everywhere in the Milky Way, and in a Green Bank L-band file it is a BROAD
(tens of kHz to a few hundred kHz) bump whose centre frequency is a Doppler
readout of the gas velocity along your line of sight. SETI deliberately hunts
near it - Drake's "water hole", 1420 (HI) to 1720 (OH) MHz - which means SETI
data is *full* of the galaxy's own hydrogen.

The masers are worse mimics: OH at 1612.231 / 1665.402 / 1667.359 / 1720.530 MHz,
methanol at 6668.519 / 12178.593 MHz, water at 22235.08 MHz. These are genuinely
narrowband (down to a few kHz), genuinely bright, and genuinely NOT artificial -
nature's own carriers. Any recipe claiming a technosignature has to clear them.

This recipe finds them ON PURPOSE and reports the velocity, so you can tell "the
galaxy" from "a transmitter". Run it on your own BL download with
`python natural_signals.py <file>` for the full report and figure.

Line frequencies: HI from Essen et al. 1971 / IAU adopted value; OH and maser
rest frequencies per Lovas, NIST Recommended Rest Frequencies (2004).
