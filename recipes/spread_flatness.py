"""Spread-spectrum / "structured noise" detector - setiTuna's own novel line of
attack (NOVEL_DETECTORS.md #1 and #4; cyclo.py + entropy.py are the IQ-domain
versions, validated at -10 dB SNR and on 7/7 real digital captures).

The blind spot this attacks: human radio went from loud narrowband carriers
(1900) to noise-like spread-spectrum and OFDM (5G, WiFi, GPS, military) in ONE
century. A narrowband drift search is therefore tuned to find a civilization at
exactly our 1950s stage and no other. Anyone slightly ahead of us leaks
*structured noise*, and turboSETI is structurally blind to it.

A single-dish spectrogram cannot see the cyclostationary heartbeat directly
(that needs the raw voltages - use cyclo.py for .cs16 IQ). What it CAN see is
the envelope: a WIDE band of excess power that is spectrally FLAT (noise-like,
not a pile of tones) and stays put in time. That is the spectrogram-domain
fingerprint of a spread transmitter - and it is exactly what a peak-finding
search throws away as "no signal here".

Reported candidates are honest about their ambiguity: a wide flat elevated band
is also what a broadband RFI blanket, a receiver gain step, or a continuum
source looks like. That is what the verification layer and the ON/OFF cadence
are for.
