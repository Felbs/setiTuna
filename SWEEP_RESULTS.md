# Nearby-star SETI sweep

Swept 10 targets (GBT open data, turboSETI + forensics).

| target | hits | drift rates | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| GJ699 | 87 | 2 | RFI (87 hits all at 2 drift rate(s) = instrumental) |
| GJ411 | 55 | 2 | RFI (55 hits all at 2 drift rate(s) = instrumental) |
| GJ887 | - | - | no fine-frequency GBT HDF5 (only HTR) |
| GJ273 | 89 | 2 | RFI (89 hits all at 2 drift rate(s) = instrumental) |
| GJ15A | 14 | 2 | RFI (14 hits all at 2 drift rate(s) = instrumental) |
| GJ71 | 11 | 2 | RFI (11 hits all at 2 drift rate(s) = instrumental) |
| HIP54035 | - | - | no fine-frequency GBT HDF5 (only HTR) |
| HIP57548 | - | - | no fine-frequency GBT HDF5 (only HTR) |
| GJ876 | 18 | 2 | RFI (18 hits all at 2 drift rate(s) = instrumental) |
| GJ581 | - | - | no fine-frequency GBT HDF5 (only HTR) |

**Candidates needing review: none**
## Honest notes
- 6 stars screened (Barnard's/GJ699, GJ411, GJ273, GJ15A, Tau Ceti/GJ71, GJ876);
  4 skipped (archive only had high-time-resolution files, not turboSETI-usable).
- ALL 6 = RFI: every hit pinned to ~2 drift rates (a real planet's signal drifts
  at VARIED rates; a single drift bin = instrumental artifact). Zero candidates.
- Caveat: these are MEDIUM-resolution (.0002) products with coarse drift
  resolution (~9.8 Hz/s) - a SCREENING pass, not a deep search. The hi-spectral
  (.0000, ~3 Hz) files are 15-20 GB each; a deep dive would pull those + run
  find_event over the full ON/OFF cadence. Infra is ready for it.
- The frontier isn't more narrowband screening (all clear so far) - it's the
  NOVEL detectors (cyclostationarity etc, NOVEL_DETECTORS.md) that catch what a
  drift search can't see.
